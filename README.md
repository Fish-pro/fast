# Fast

Fast is a Kubernetes CNI based on  [eBPF](https://ebpf.io)  implementation. At present, the following two capabilities have been realized
+ Network basic connectivity based on eBPF
+ Manage cluster containers' IP address

## Architecture

![fast](images/fast.png)

Components:
+ fast-cni
  + implement CNI capabilities
  + access fast-agent fetch pod IP and store to the node local eBPF map
  + attach eBPF program to NIC
+ fast-agent
  + the interface that implements IP allocation
  + obtain the cluster pod IP and store the information to the cluster eBPF map
  + init eBPF map
+ fast-controller-manager
  + custom resources control
  + gc management to prevent IP leakage
+ fast-ctl
  + node command tool for eBPF map

## Quick Start

### Single-cluster IPAM

In overlay scenario, fix the IP address of cluster containers

1.Create ips

```shell
cat << EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: sample.fast.io/v1alpha1
kind: Ips
metadata:
  name: sample-ips
spec:
  subnet: 10.244.0.1/32
  ips:
    - 10.244.10.0-10.244.90.0
EOF
```

2.Create a deployment and associate it with ips via annotations

```shell
cat << EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: busybox
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: busybox
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        fast.io/ips: sample-ips
      labels:
        app: busybox
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: busybox
          image: busybox:latest
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          command:
            - sleep
            - "10000"
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 80
              protocol: TCP
EOF
```

3.View the IP address of the container

The IP address of the container is fixed in the range defined by the ips

```shell
[root@york-master ~]# kubectl get po -o wide
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP            NODE          NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
busybox-757455cf7-4p9fq   1/1     Running   0          4s    10.244.10.1   10-29-15-49   <none>           <none>
busybox-757455cf7-f5lr9   1/1     Running   0          4s    10.244.10.0   10-29-15-50   <none>           <none>
```

### Network connectivity test

1.Create another application

```bash
cat << EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: sample.fast.io/v1alpha1
kind: Ips
metadata:
  name: default-ips
spec:
  subnet: 10.244.0.1/32
  ips:
    - 10.244.100.0-10.244.200.250
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: busybox1
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: busybox1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: busybox1
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: busybox1
          image: busybox:latest
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          command:
            - sleep
            - "10000"
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 80
              protocol: TCP
EOF
```

Once created, there are four containers

```shell
[root@york-master ~]# kubectl get po -o wide
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP             NODE          NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
busybox-757455cf7-4p9fq     1/1     Running   0          2m11s   10.244.10.1    10-29-15-49   <none>           <none>
busybox-757455cf7-f5lr9     1/1     Running   0          2m11s   10.244.10.0    10-29-15-50   <none>           <none>
busybox1-5f98488b8d-2xc49   1/1     Running   0          10s     10.244.100.0   10-29-15-50   <none>           <none>
busybox1-5f98488b8d-v42dq   1/1     Running   0          10s     10.244.100.1   10-29-15-49   <none>           <none>
```

2.Same node container network connection

We can see that the network is reachable

```shell
[root@york-master ~]# kubectl exec -it busybox-757455cf7-4p9fq -- ping 10.244.100.1
PING 10.244.100.1 (10.244.100.1): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.244.100.1: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.398 ms
64 bytes from 10.244.100.1: seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.117 ms
64 bytes from 10.244.100.1: seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.098 ms
64 bytes from 10.244.100.1: seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.111 ms
64 bytes from 10.244.100.1: seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.111 ms
^C
--- 10.244.100.1 ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 5 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.098/0.167/0.398 ms
```

3.Different nodes container network connection

We can see that the network is reachable too

```shell
[root@york-master ~]# kubectl exec -it busybox-757455cf7-4p9fq -- ping 10.244.100.0
PING 10.244.100.0 (10.244.100.0): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.244.100.0: seq=0 ttl=64 time=1.029 ms
64 bytes from 10.244.100.0: seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.593 ms
64 bytes from 10.244.100.0: seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.614 ms
64 bytes from 10.244.100.0: seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.522 ms
64 bytes from 10.244.100.0: seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.704 ms
^C
--- 10.244.100.0 ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 5 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.522/0.692/1.029 ms
```
